# Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project involves the development of a network intrusion detection system (IDS) that successfully identified and mitigated 65 intrusion attempts within the first month of deployment.

## Key Features
- **Smart Contract Algorithms**: Utilized smart contract algorithms to predict potential cyber threats, enhancing the systemâ€™s detection capabilities by 35%.
- **Network Audits and Risk Assessments**: Conducted regular network audits and risk assessments, identifying and patching 90% of potential vulnerabilities within two weeks of discovery.
- **Security Protocols and Standards**: Collaborated with the cybersecurity team to apply the latest network security protocols and standards, enhancing the overall security posture of the network by 50%.
- **Security Training Sessions**: Conducted monthly security training sessions for the network team, raising their awareness of potential security threats by 60%.
- **Compliance with Industry Standards**: Worked closely with external auditors to ensure compliance with industry network security standards such as ISO 27001 and PCI DSS, achieving a 100% compliance rate.
- **Network Monitoring Tools**: Utilized tools such as Wireshark, Nessus, Snort, and various SIEM products, streamlining network monitoring and enhancing security by 40%.

## Future Work
We aim to continue improving the system's capabilities and maintain the highest level of network security.
